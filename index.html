BSIT offers practical and hands-on learning that prepares students for the real-world demands of the IT industry.
 I chose this course because it focuses on skills that are in high demand today, such as programming, networking, database management,
  and cybersecurity.  These are areas Iâ€™m very interested in, and I know that mastering them will
  open doors to many career opportunities. I want a degree that will not only educate me but also give me an edge in the job
